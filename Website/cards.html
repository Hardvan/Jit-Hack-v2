                During recent years, the rate of heart attacks has been on the
                rise. In India alone, there were arround 28,449 deaths due to
                heart attacks. The edge that we have over other products is that
                we have the luxury of a pre-trained model which can predict the
                heart attack to a great extent.

                details such as oxygen %, heart rate, etc. and submit it. Our
                pre-trained machine learning model will accurately predict
                whether the person will get heart attack or not. Based on the
                result appropriate course of action will be provided to the
                users.
